# Food-Price-Analysis-in-Bangladesh
# Introduction:
The information used in this analysis are derived from the World Food Programme (WFP), comprising food price information collected in various divisions in Bangladesh for a few years (1998â€“2024). It includes significant variables such as type of commodity, market location, administrative region, types of prices (wholesale/retail), and pattern of time. This work attempts to analyze long-term trends in prices of staple food items like rice, wheat, lentils, and oil, helping to identify market imbalances, regional gaps, and suggest regulatory areas of focus. Bangladesh being susceptible to climatic shocks, economic upheavals, and global events like the COVID-19 pandemic, this work serves as a decision-support tool for government agencies, NGOs, and policy makers.
